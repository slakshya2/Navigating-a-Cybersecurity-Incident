## Project Goals
The primary goals of this project include:
- Developing a structured incident response plan based on industry best practices.
- Identifying key roles and responsibilities within the incident response team.
- Establishing communication protocols for internal and external stakeholders.
- Conducting a post-incident analysis to improve future response efforts.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/slakshya2/Navigating-a-Cybersecurity-Incident.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd Navigating-a-Cybersecurity-Incident

## Usage
This project includes various documentation and templates to assist in navigating a cybersecurity incident. Follow the guidelines in the respective documents to develop and implement your incident response plan.

Key Steps in the Project:
- Incident Identification: Outline the processes for detecting and reporting potential incidents, including the use of monitoring tools and user reports.
- Incident Classification: Develop criteria for classifying incidents based on severity and impact on the organization.
- Response Strategies: Create response strategies for different types of incidents, including data breaches, malware infections, and denial-of-service attacks.
- Communication Plan: Establish a communication plan that details how information will be shared with stakeholders, including employees, management, and external partners.
- Post-Incident Review: Implement a process for conducting post-incident reviews to analyze the response and identify areas for improvement.

## Incident Response Framework:
The incident response framework follows the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which includes the following phases:

- Preparation: Establish and train the incident response team, and develop incident response policies and procedures.
- Detection and Analysis: Monitor systems for signs of incidents and analyze alerts to determine the nature and scope of the incident.
- Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Implement measures to contain the incident, eradicate the threat, and recover affected systems.
- Post-Incident Activity: Conduct a thorough review of the incident to identify lessons learned and update the incident response plan accordingly.

## Findings and Recommendations
Throughout the project, several key findings were identified, including:

- Incident Detection Gaps: Identified areas where monitoring tools could be improved to enhance incident detection capabilities.
- Communication Challenges: Recommended establishing clearer communication protocols to ensure timely updates during an incident.
- Training Needs: Suggested regular training sessions for the incident response team to stay updated on the latest threats and response techniques.
For detailed findings and specific recommendations, please refer to the reports included in the reports/ directory.

## Automation Opportunities
The following areas were identified for potential automation within the incident response process:

- Alerting System: Automate the alerting process to notify the incident response team of potential incidents in real-time.
- Incident Logging: Develop a script to automatically log incidents and responses for future analysis and reporting.
- Threat Intelligence Integration: Implement automated integration of threat intelligence feeds to enhance situational awareness during incidents.
